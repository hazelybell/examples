example:
adfasdf
asfasdf

3 cases (pick the longest!)
adfasd vs asfasdf (removed 1 letter from first string)
    LCS would be afasd length 5
adfasdf vs asfasd (removed 1 letter 
from second string)
    LCS would be afasd length 5
adfasd vs asfasd (removed 1 letter from both) + 1 if the letters i removed were the same
    LCS would be afasdf length 6
    
lcs(m, n)
    if m or n is 0:
        return 0
    return max of
        lcs(m-1, n)
        lcs(m, n-1)
        lcs(m-1, n-1) + 1 string1 character m and string2 character n are the same
