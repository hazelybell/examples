There's more than one way to do it!

-> check the lecture notes for the 4-D method

Hazel's Approach:

-> Modify your LCS routine to return *every* CS instead of just *one* LCS

!!!! We have to include CS's that aren't
a subsequence of an LCS but we don't have to include any sequences that are
subsequences of a longer sequence !!!!

Harrison Fah's example: 0120 and 0012

00 is the LCPS/LCTS but 012 is the only LCS.


-> We need a function that will check if one seq is a subsequence of another sequence quickly (this is straightforward)

-> Then you have a list of LCSs of the two input sequences, which are all the same length

-> Any other CS of the two input sequences
must be a subsequence of one of our LCSs

-> Apply LPS/LTS to each LCS in our list

-> Pick a longest one
