There are 3 parts to memory:

* Memory to hold your program itself
     * Includes literals
* Stack
     * Local variables and VLAs
     * Parameters to functions
     * Local static length arrays
* Heap
     * extra memory your program can use for some purpose
     * BUT we have to ask the OS for heap memory
